# Mayzax ATS

**Mayzax ATS** is a production-grade Recruitment Applicant Tracking System built for **Mayzax Solutions**. It lets Admins manage recruiters and candidate profiles, lets Recruiters log job applications against their assigned profiles, and gives Admins a real-time analytics dashboard — all keyed off Mayzax's night-shift **business date** instead of the calendar date.

## Architecture

Mayzax ATS follows **clean architecture** with a clear separation of concerns on both tiers:

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) |
| State/Data | React Hook Form + Zod (forms) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express + TypeScript |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh) with rotation, bcrypt, HttpOnly cookies |

## Database Schema

Defined in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Key models:

### `User`

```
id, name, email (unique), passwordHash, role (ADMIN|RECRUITER),
isActive, deletedAt (soft delete), lastActiveAt, createdById (self-relation),
createdAt, updatedAt
```

### `RefreshToken`

```
id, userId (FK), tokenHash (unique, SHA-256 — raw tokens are never stored),
userAgent, ip, expiresAt, revokedAt, replacedByTokenHash, createdAt
```

### `ClientProfile`

```
id, candidateName, email, phone, technology, notes,
assignedRecruiterId (FK → User, nullable),
isActive, deletedAt (soft delete), createdAt, updatedAt
```

### `JobApplication`

```
id, profileId (FK), recruiterId (FK), jobLink, normalizedJobLink,
companyName, jobTitle, jobPortal (enum), status (enum),
appliedAt, businessDate (DATE),
createdAt, updatedAt

UNIQUE (profileId, normalizedJobLink)   ← duplicate-detection constraint
INDEX  (recruiterId), (profileId), (businessDate), (status)
```

### `AuditLog`

```
id, userId (FK, nullable), action, entity, entityId, metadata (JSON),
ip, userAgent, createdAt

```

Enums: `Role {ADMIN, RECRUITER}`, `ApplicationStatus {APPLIED, IN_REVIEW, SHORTLISTED, INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED, INTERVIEWED, OFFERED, REJECTED, WITHDRAWN, ON_HOLD}`, `JobPortal {LINKEDIN, INDEED, NAUKRI, DICE, MONSTER, ZIPRECRUITER, GLASSDOOR, COMPANY_WEBSITE, CAREERBUILDER, OTHER}`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- PostgreSQL ≥ 14
- npm ≥ 9

The root `package.json` provides orchestration scripts so you rarely need to `cd` into `backend/` or `frontend/` directly.

### Fastest path: one-command setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url> mayzax-ats
cd mayzax-ats
npm run install:all           # installs required node modules
```

Create `backend/.env` & `frontend/.env` afterwards and set real values for various environment variables
Then run below command for project setup

```bash
npm run setup          
```

The seed step prints the generated admin credentials — **log in and change the password immediately** (see `POST /auth/change-password`).
Use below command to seed sample data in DB

```bash
SEED_DEMO_DATA=true npm run seed         
```

### Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the API and the web app **concurrently** in one terminal, with color-coded `[API]` / `[WEB]` log prefixes:

- API → `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`
- Web → `http://localhost:5173`

Or run them separately in two terminals if you prefer:

```bash
npm run dev:backend     # API only
npm run dev:frontend    # Web app only
```

## API Reference

All routes are versioned under `API_PREFIX` (default `/api/v1`). Responses follow a consistent envelope:

```json
// Success
{ "success": true, "data": ..., "pagination": { ... } }

```

## Deployment Checklist

Before going to production:

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`.
2. Generate strong, unique `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
3. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` and serve over HTTPS (required for `Secure` cookies to work).
4. Point `DATABASE_URL` amd `DIRECT_URL`at a managed/production Postgres instance.
5. Run `npm run seed` once against production to create the first Admin, then **change that password immediately**.
6. Set `CLIENT_URL` to your production frontend origin (CORS).
7. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your production API URL and rebuild the frontend.
8. Put the API behind a reverse proxy / load balancer that forwards `X-Forwarded-For` (the app trusts proxy hop `1`).
9. Review `RATE_LIMIT_*` values for expected production traffic.
10. Ship logs (`pino` JSON output) to your log aggregator of choice.
